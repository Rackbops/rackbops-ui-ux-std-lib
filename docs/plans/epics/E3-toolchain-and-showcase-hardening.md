# E3 -- Toolchain and showcase hardening: implementation plan, PR A (#112 + #113 + #114)

Epic #179. This plan covers PR A: #112 (`@rackbops/ui-react` entry points), #113 (changelog grammar), #114 (`release.yml` gates), entered via `/work-on 112`, closing all three. PRs B, C and D get their own plans as they are picked up. Written by the orchestrator on 2026-09-10 against `origin/main` at `be09088` (v0.2.30); line numbers are from that commit -- re-check with `grep -n` before editing. Committed on the branch as `docs/plans/epics/E3-toolchain-and-showcase-hardening.md` in the first commit; later PRs append their sections to the same file.

## Locked decisions

1. **#112: `main` and `types` mirror `exports["."]`**, guarded by a package-shape test that lives inside the React package as `src/package-shape.test.tsx` -- the package's test glob is `src/**/*.test.tsx` (`components/react/package.json:29`), so a `.test.ts` would never run, and `release-lib.sh`'s PATHSPEC (`:46-47`) already excludes `*.test.tsx` from release triggers. `styles/package.json` is CSS-only with no JS entry point; it is out of scope and the PR says so.
2. **#113: `revert` joins the changelog after `fix`** (section title "Reverts"), and a `type!:` / `type(scope)!:` subject renders as `- BREAKING: <description>` under its own type. `BREAKING CHANGE:` footers stay invisible to the notes: the changelog walks a `%s` subjects-only stream (`release.sh:50`, `release-notes.sh:31`) while the bump reads `%B` (`release.sh:67`); that asymmetry is documented, not changed. `next-version.sh` already bumps the minor for `revert!:` (`:23`, any `[a-z]+!:`) -- pinned with one `bump.test.mjs` case so the two grammars cannot drift silently again.
3. **#114: a job-level gate on a repository variable, `vars.RELEASE_ENABLED == 'true'`.** `secrets` is unavailable in a job-level `if` (`release.yml:30-33` says so); `vars` is. The orchestrator set `RELEASE_ENABLED=true` on this repo on 2026-09-10 (`gh variable list` shows it), so releases keep flowing the moment this merges; a fork or a repo without the variable skips before a runner is provisioned. The step-level secret check (`:71-74`) stays as defence in depth -- a variable without the secret still no-ops instead of attempting a doomed push. The bump-commit guard is scoped to the identity `release.yml:59` configures: skip only when the subject starts with `chore(release): v` **and** `github.event.head_commit.author.name == 'github-actions[bot]'` (verified: the last three bump commits on `main` are authored by exactly that name).
4. **Nothing in `styles/`, `contract.json`, the showcase or the React source changes** -- no baselines, no SKILL.md regeneration. Docs touched: `README.md` Publishing (`:160-188`) and `CONTEXT.md` Release (`:59-66`), both of which state behaviour this PR changes.
5. **Never run `release.sh`, `release-notes.sh` or `publish-release.sh` by hand against the real checkout** -- only through `styles/test/helpers/release-repo.mjs`'s scratch repos. `release.test.mjs:22-35` records the one time that pushed a real tag by accident.

## Build order (one commit per step, Conventional Commits)

### 1. Plan file -- `docs(plans): E3 toolchain and showcase hardening, PR A plan`

This document, verbatim, at `docs/plans/epics/E3-toolchain-and-showcase-hardening.md`.

### 2. #112 -- `fix(react): declare main and types so exports-blind resolvers find the package`

`components/react/package.json:20`, immediately before `"exports"`:

```
  "main": "./dist/index.js",
  "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
```

New `components/react/src/package-shape.test.tsx` (no JSX needed; the extension is what the test glob matches):

```tsx
import { test } from "node:test";
import assert from "node:assert/strict";
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";

const pkg = JSON.parse(readFileSync(new URL("../package.json", import.meta.url), "utf-8"));

test('package.json: main and types mirror exports["."] so exports-blind resolvers see the same entry (#112)', () => {
  const root = pkg.exports["."];
  assert.equal(pkg.main, root.default, "main must name the same file as exports['.'].default");
  assert.equal(pkg.types, root.types, "types must name the same file as exports['.'].types");
  assert.match(pkg.main, /^\.\/dist\//);
  assert.match(pkg.types, /^\.\/dist\/.*\.d\.ts$/);
});
```

Do not assert that `dist/` exists: the package test runs `tsc --noEmit` first and never builds.

### 3. #113 -- `fix(release): file revert!: under Reverts and mark breaking subjects in the changelog`

`.github/scripts/release-lib.sh`:

- `:68`: `COMMIT_TYPES_ORDER=(feat fix revert perf refactor chore docs style test build ci)`.
- `:70-81`: add `[revert]="Reverts"` after `[fix]`.
- `:97-103`: the pattern captures the bang as its own group: `local pattern='^([a-z]+)(\([^)]*\))?(!?):[[:space:]]+(.+)$'` (type 1, scope 2, bang 3, description 4). Rewrite the comment above it: the bang is captured so a breaking subject is both kept under its type and marked; footers are not visible here (subjects-only stream), only to `next-version.sh`, which reads full bodies for the bump.
- `:111-112`:

```bash
    if [[ "$msg" =~ $pattern ]] && [[ -n "${COMMIT_TYPE_NAMES[${BASH_REMATCH[1]}]+x}" ]]; then
      local marker=""
      [[ -n "${BASH_REMATCH[3]}" ]] && marker="BREAKING: "
      type_entries[${BASH_REMATCH[1]}]+="- ${marker}${BASH_REMATCH[4]}"$'\n'
```

`styles/test/release.test.mjs`, after the grouping test (`:451-473`), same fixture style:

- `release-notes.sh: revert!: lands under Reverts with the BREAKING marker; a breaking feat keeps its section and gains the marker; a plain feat has none` -- commits (each on its own `styles/<X>.txt`): `revert!: drop the legacy tokens`, `feat!: rename the accent tokens`, `feat: plain feature`, `revert: undo the badge tweak`; tag `v0.1.1`, push the tag; assert `/### Reverts[\s\S]*- BREAKING: drop the legacy tokens/`, `/### Reverts[\s\S]*- undo the badge tweak/`, `/### Features[\s\S]*- BREAKING: rename the accent tokens/`, `/### Features[\s\S]*- plain feature/`, `assert.doesNotMatch(notes, /BREAKING: plain feature/)`, `assert.doesNotMatch(notes, /BREAKING: undo/)`, and section order `notes.indexOf("### Features") < notes.indexOf("### Bug Fixes") || notes.indexOf("### Bug Fixes") === -1` is not needed -- assert only `notes.indexOf("### Features") < notes.indexOf("### Reverts")`.

`styles/test/bump.test.mjs`, in the existing breaking-subject test (`:31-34`): add `assert.equal(next("0.2.3", "revert!: drop the legacy tokens"), "0.3.0");`.

Docs: `CONTEXT.md:61-66` gains one sentence after the bump description: "Release notes (`release-notes.sh`) group subjects by type -- feat, fix, revert, perf, refactor, chore, docs, style, test, build, ci -- and prefix a `type!:` subject with `BREAKING:`; a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer drives the bump but is not visible to the subjects-only notes (#113)." `README.md:162-171`: the same fact in one clause after "commits, and tags".

`bash -n .github/scripts/release-lib.sh`; `shellcheck` if installed (say so if not -- it is not on the orchestrator's machine).

### 4. #114 -- `ci(release): gate the job on RELEASE_ENABLED and scope the bump guard to the release bot`

`.github/workflows/release.yml`:

- `:34-37` becomes:

```yaml
    if: >-
      ${{ vars.RELEASE_ENABLED == 'true' &&
      github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' &&
      (github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' ||
      !(startsWith(github.event.head_commit.message, 'chore(release): v') &&
        github.event.head_commit.author.name == 'github-actions[bot]')) }}
```

- `:23-33` comment: keep the branch reasoning; replace the "`secrets` context is NOT available" sentence's conclusion with: the inert gate is therefore a repository **variable**, `RELEASE_ENABLED`, which `vars` exposes to a job-level `if`, so a repo without it skips before any checkout; the secret check in the step remains for a variable-without-secret repo. Add: the bump guard names the bot identity configured below so a human commit that merely starts with `chore(release): v` is still released.
- `:70-74` run block: first line `set -u`; `if [[ -z "${GH_TOKEN:-}" ]]; then`; the echoed message stays byte-identical (README `:181` quotes it).
- `workflow_dispatch` carries no `head_commit`, so `startsWith(null, ...)` is false and the `!( ... )` clause is true, exactly as today -- say so in the comment.

`README.md:175-188`: the `release` bullet now says it needs **both** the `RELEASE_TOKEN` secret and a `RELEASE_ENABLED` repository variable set to `true`; without the variable the job is skipped before a runner is provisioned (previously every non-bump push checked out full history just to print Skipping); without the secret it no-ops as before. Keep the quoted message and the local-fallback sentences.

No unit test can exercise a workflow file; step 5 of Acceptance is the guard.

## Mutation guards (each must turn the suite red; paste one failing assertion per row)

| Change | Mutation | Failing test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #112 `main` | delete the `main` line | `package.json: main and types mirror exports["."] ...` |
| #112 `types` | point `types` at `./dist/other.d.ts` | same test |
| #113 `revert` type | remove `revert` from `COMMIT_TYPES_ORDER` | the Reverts assertion (lands in Other Changes) |
| #113 marker | set `marker=""` unconditionally | the two `BREAKING:` assertions |
| #113 marker gating | set `marker="BREAKING: "` unconditionally | the two `doesNotMatch` assertions |
| #113 bump parity | in `next-version.sh:23`, change `!:` to `:` in `subject_re` | the new `revert!:` case and the existing `feat!:` cases in `bump.test.mjs` |
| #114 | not unit-testable | Acceptance 5 (a real run under the new gate) |

## Acceptance to execute and paste

1. `pnpm --filter @rackbops/ui-react test` green, the package-shape test name visible.
2. Consumer check for #112: `pnpm --filter @rackbops/ui-react build`, then `pnpm pack` in `components/react`; in a temp dir, `npm init -y`, install the tarball, write `tsconfig.json` with `{"compilerOptions":{"module":"commonjs","moduleResolution":"node10","strict":true,"noEmit":true,"jsx":"react-jsx","skipLibCheck":true}}` and `consumer.ts` = `import { Button } from "@rackbops/ui-react"; export const b = Button;` -- paste `npx tsc` **before** the package.json change (install the tarball built from `main`: expect TS2307) and **after** (clean); paste `node -e "console.log(require.resolve('@rackbops/ui-react'))"` printing the `dist/index.js` path.
3. `pnpm --filter @rackbops/styles test` green with the new release-notes test and the bump case visible; `bash -n .github/scripts/release-lib.sh` clean.
4. `gh variable list` showing `RELEASE_ENABLED  true` (orchestrator-set); paste.
5. **After merge, jointly with the orchestrator:** the PR's squash commit touches `components/react/package.json` (in PATHSPEC), so it triggers `release.yml` under the new gate. Paste `gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit 3 --json conclusion,displayTitle`: the fix run **success** (reached the script, cut the next patch), the bump push **skipped**. Paste `gh release view <new tag> --json body -q .body` showing the grouped notes. Paste `npm view @rackbops/ui-react@<new version> main types` showing both fields on the registry.
6. The mutation table, one pasted failure per row.
7. `pnpm test` (root) and `pnpm build` green.

## Exit demo (PR A's share of the epic's exit criterion)

`@rackbops/ui-react` resolves under `moduleResolution: node10` from a real tarball; `revert!:` renders under Reverts with a BREAKING marker in a scratch-repo release; the first post-merge push to `main` produced a release run that was **not** skipped and a bot bump push that **was**, with no runner provisioned for the latter.

## Sub's operating rules

- Read #112, #113, #114 and #179 in full, including comments, before touching anything.
- Own worktree from `origin/main` (fetch first: `main` is at `be09088`, v0.2.30); never `git stash`; `git -C`, never `cd && git`; no force-push.
- Decision 5 above is absolute: the release scripts run only inside the test harness.
- Run the review gate yourself (two read-only adversarial agents, different lenses: correctness/failure modes on the bash regex change and the workflow expression vs. claims-vs-code walking the acceptance list and the README/CONTEXT sentences), up to four rounds, then report the round count and findings to the orchestrator rather than starting a fifth.
- Report deviations as they arise. Do not merge; Acceptance 5 happens after the orchestrator merges and is pasted by whoever runs it -- the orchestrator will ask you to.
